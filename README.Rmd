# leafpm - Interactively Edit Spatial Vector Features in R

[![Travis build status](https://travis-ci.org/r-spatial/leafpm.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/r-spatial/leafpm)

`leafpm` is a plugin for [`leaflet`](https://github.com/rstudio/leaflet) to provide map editing and drawing in R with [`Leaflet.pm`](https://github.com/codeofsumit/leaflet.pm).  It is based closely off of [`leaflet.extras`](https://github.com/bhaskarvk/leaflet.extras) `addDrawToolbar()`.  `leafpm` is intended to supplement `leaflet.extras` with better support for snapping and holes.


## Installation

You can install the released version of leafpm from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("leafpm")
```

## Example

``` r
library(mapview)
library(leafpm)
library(sf)

outer1 = matrix(c(0,0,10,0,10,10,0,10,0,0),ncol=2, byrow=TRUE)
hole1 = matrix(c(1,1,1,2,2,2,2,1,1,1),ncol=2, byrow=TRUE)
hole2 = matrix(c(5,5,5,6,6,6,6,5,5,5),ncol=2, byrow=TRUE)
outer2 = matrix(c(11,0,11,1,12,1,12,0,11,0),ncol=2, byrow=TRUE)

pts1 = list(outer1, hole1, hole2)
pts2 = list(outer2)

pl1 = st_sf(geom = st_sfc(st_polygon(pts1)))
pl2 = st_sf(geom = st_sfc(st_polygon(pts2)))

mpl = st_sf(geom = st_combine(rbind(pl1, pl2)))

addPmToolbar(
  mapview(mpl)@map,
  targetGroup = "mpl"
)
```


## mapedit Integration

`leafpm` was designed to work as an editor in [`mapedit`](https://github.com/r-spatial/mapedit), so you can get your edits back into the `R` session.  For instance,

``` r
#install.packages("mapedit")
library(mapedit)

drawFeatures(editor = "leafpm")
```
